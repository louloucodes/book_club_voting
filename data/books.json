        "summary": "Selected by The Atlantic as one of THE GREAT AMERICAN NOVELS. (\"You have to read them.\") The New York Times best-selling author\u2019s time-travel classic that makes us feel the horrors of American slavery and indicts our country\u2019s lack of progress on racial reconciliation \u201cI lost an arm on my last trip home. My left arm.\u201d Dana\u2019s torment begins when she suddenly vanishes on her 26th birthday from California, 1976, and is dragged through time to antebellum Maryland to rescue a boy named Rufus, heir to a slaveowner\u2019s plantation. She soon realizes the purpose of her summons to the past: protect Rufus to ensure his assault of her Black ancestor so that she may one day be born. As she endures the traumas of slavery and the soul-crushing normalization of savagery, Dana fights to keep her autonomy and return to the present. Blazing the trail for neo-slavery narratives like Colson Whitehead\u2019s The Underground Railroad and Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019s The Water Dancer, Butler takes one of speculative fiction\u2019s oldest tropes and infuses it with lasting depth and power. Dana not only experiences the cruelties of slavery on her skin but also grimly learns to accept it as a condition of her own existence in the present. \u201cWhere stories about American slavery are often gratuitous, reducing its horror to explicit violence and brutality, Kindred is controlled and precise\u201d (New York Times).",

It did not look important - even a child could climb it. But the idea was real. Like all walls it was ambiguous, two-faced. What was inside it and what was outside it depended upon which side of it you were on...' Shevek is brilliant scientist who is attempting to find a new theory of time - but there are those who are jealous of his work, and will do anything to block him. So he leaves his homeland, hoping to find a place of more liberty and tolerance. Initially feted, Shevek soon finds himself being used as a pawn in a deadly political game. With powerful themes of freedom, society and the natural world's influence on competition and co-operation, THE DISPOSSESSED is a true classic of the 20th century.",
