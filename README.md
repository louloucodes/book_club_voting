# Book Club Voting App

## üìñ Project Description

This project is a multi-page web application designed for a book club to easily vote on their next book. The application provides a public-facing area for members to view the book list and vote, and a separate, password-protected admin panel for managing the book list. The goal is to provide a straightforward and user-friendly interface with a clear separation between user and administrator capabilities.

## ‚≠ê Features

*   **Multi-Page Interface:** Separate pages for landing, voting, and administration for a clean user experience.
*   **Rich Book Display:** Displays a list of books with detailed information including cover image, title, author, and summary.
*   **Live Voting:** Users can click a "Vote" button next to each book. The vote is registered on the backend without needing a page refresh.
*   **Real-Time Results:** Vote counts next to each book are updated dynamically as votes are cast.
*   **Password-Protected Admin Panel:**
    *   Secure login for administrators.
    *   Add new books to the list via a simple form.
    *   Delete existing books.
    *   Reorder the book list for the voting page using an intuitive drag-and-drop interface.
*   **Export to CSV:** A simple "Export Results" button allows users to download the current vote counts as a `.csv` file.

## üèóÔ∏è Software Architecture

The application is built with a clean, scalable structure that separates concerns using Flask Blueprints and a centralized configuration.

*   **`config.py`:** Centralizes application configuration. It loads sensitive data like the `SECRET_KEY` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` from environment variables for improved security.
*   **`app.py`:** The main entry point for the Flask application. It initializes the app, loads the configuration, and registers the application's blueprints.
*   **`src/` directory:** Contains the core backend logic, organized into blueprints and data modules.
    *   **`admin.py`:** A Flask Blueprint that encapsulates all administrative functionality, including login, logout, and all book management routes (add, delete, reorder).
    *   **`books.py`:** Defines the `Book` and `BookStore` classes, managing all data loading, saving, and in-memory storage in an object-oriented way.
*   **`templates/`:** Contains all Jinja2 HTML templates, including a `base.html` for a consistent layout across all pages.
*   **`static/`:** Contains all frontend assets.
    *   **`css/`:** CSS is organized into a component-based structure (`_navbar.css`, `_forms.css`, etc.) and imported into a single `main.css` file for maintainability.
    *   **`js/`:** Contains the client-side JavaScript for handling dynamic features like voting and admin actions.

## üíª Technology Stack

*   **Backend:** Python with the **Flask** web framework.
*   **Frontend:** Vanilla **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
*   **Data Storage:**
    *   A static `data/books.json` file is used as the database for the book list.
    *   **Flask Sessions** are used for admin authentication.
    *   Vote counts are stored in-memory on the server.

## üöÄ Local Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash

    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Create the environment file:** Create a file named `.env` in the project root and add the following variables. This file is ignored by Git.
    ```
    # .env
    SECRET_KEY='generate-a-long-random-string-for-this'
    ADMIN_PASSWORD='your-chosen-admin-password'
    ```

5.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    flask run
    ```
